## Quarkino Task

### Getting Started

To quickly set up and run this task, I've utilized "laravel sail" for seamless execution. Follow these steps after cloning or unzipping the project:

1. Ensure Composer is installed on your system.

2. Launch the Laravel Sail containers and network by running the following command:

```shell
sail up -d 
```

### Warmin Up the Project

If you wish to start the project without manually setting up, use the following "quarkino" artisan command:
```shell
sail shell
php artisan quarkino
```
Alternatively, you can manually apply migrations and seed the database:

```
sail shell
php artisan migrate
php artisan db:seed
```
Upon executing the "quarkino" command, a user named quarkino with the password also set as quarkino will be generated.

Now you're all set to explore and interact with the project. Enjoy your experience with Laravel Sail!
Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.
